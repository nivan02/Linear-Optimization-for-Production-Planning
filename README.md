# 🧵 Production & Outsourcing Optimization – Textile Industry Case

This project focuses on optimizing **production and outsourcing strategies** for a textile manufacturer using **Excel-based linear programming models**. The analysis evaluates internal production capacity, outsourcing costs, and supplier trade-offs to develop a strategy that minimizes costs while fulfilling demand and respecting operational constraints.

## 📌 Project Overview

The company faced challenges in balancing its internal capacity with outsourcing to six local mills. Rising demand, limited production hours, and cost variations across suppliers required a structured decision-making approach. The project addressed questions such as:

- How should production be allocated between in-house facilities and external suppliers?  
- Is it financially beneficial to upgrade capacity or rent new machinery?  
- What is the minimum price needed to profitably serve new client demand?  
- How sensitive is the production strategy to changes in costs or supplier capacity?

## 🔍 Methodology

1. **Data Analysis**  
   - Evaluated supplier costs, setup charges, and transportation expenses.  
   - Incorporated machine-hour limits and production capacities.  
   - Used demand forecasts for four yarn types (extra fine, fine, medium, coarse).  

2. **Optimization Model**  
   - Objective function: minimize total production and outsourcing costs.  
   - Constraints: supplier capacity, machine-hour limits, and client demand fulfillment.  
   - Developed in Excel with solver-based linear programming.  

3. **Scenario Testing**  
   - Evaluated small capacity upgrades.  
   - Analyzed renting new spinning machines.  
   - Tested the impact of new client orders.  
   - Ran sensitivity checks on ±5% production cost changes.  
   - Adjusted allocations when supplier capacity changed.
